!2 Management
Management primarily contain the functionality which is used to control
the system, including altering settings. Adding a system specific !-MasterKey-!
as well as creating Members, Circles of Trust and assign Members as Trustees to
the Circles.

'''Important'''; ''The very first request made with the '''admin''' account will
also set the password for the administrator. By default, the passphrase is empty
or undefined. Which means that it can be set to anything the administrator
prefers, thus preventing that someone forgets to change the default. It is
recommended that common best practices regarding the pick of the passphrase is
followed - for the sake of this test, it is set to 'admin'.''

!anchor version
!4 '''Version'''
The Version request is a simple ping check, which is the only not requiring any
credentials to invoke.

REST (POST) request is: [PROTOCOL://HOST:PORT]/cws/version
Example: https://cws.company.com:8080/cws/version

!anchor masterkey
!4 '''!-MasterKey-!'''
The !-MasterKey-!, is a special System Key, which is not stored anywhere. It is being created at startup and lives only in the memory of
the system until shut down. The !-MasterKey-! is used for multiple internal things, such as extra key to unlock accounts. It is therefore
not possible to update the !-MasterKey-!, once the system is being used, since it would essentually convert the CWS database to a brick,
since all keys becomes invalid.

There are 2 ways to set the !-MasterKey-! to something else than the default, either by using the !-MasterKey WebService-! request or by
setting a URL, from which the raw data to build the key from can be read. To prevent any problems, in the following, the !-MasterKey-! is
reverted to the original, to ensure that the next test run will also work.

REST (POST) request is: [PROTOCOL://HOST:PORT]/cws/masterKey
Example: https://cws.company.com:8080/cws/masterKey

|master key                                                                                              |
|account name|credential|url                                 |secret|return code?|return message?        |
|admin       |admin     |null                                |admin |${SUCCESS}  |!-MasterKey-! unlocked.|

|admin       |admin     |null                                |admin |${SUCCESS}  |!-MasterKey-! updated. |

It should be noted, that unlocking can always be done, but changing the !-MasterKey-! cannot be done once member accounts exists, since
it is not possible for an administrator to update the member keys.

!5 Symmetric Algorithm
The primary part of all internal encryption is performed using Symmetric Keys. These are all based on the AES algorithms and only the
size of the keys may be changed. The default value is '''AES256''', but if an earlier version of Java 8 is used, or if there is various
problems with allowing this Key size, then it can be set to a lower value.
The allowed values are:
 * '''AES_CBC_128'''
 * '''AES_CBC_192'''
 * '''AES_CBC_256'''
 * '''AES_GCM_128'''

Pending Algorithms:
 * '''AES_GCM_192'''
 * '''AES_GCM_256'''

!5 Asymmetric Algorithm
Each Member Account will have a Asymmetric Key generated by default, this is used to encrypt and decrypt the Symmetric Keys, as well as Signing and Verifying signatures.
Higher Key size will give higher security. However, Asymmetric encryption/decryption is very costly compared to Symmetric cryptography. Hence, the use of these Keys is
minimized. The default value is '''RSA2048''', increasing this to a higher Key size, will have a drastic performance cost, and should only be done if a higher level of
security is needed or if enough CWS instances with enough resources is being used, so the cost can be mitigated.
The allowed values are:
 * '''RSA_2048'''
 * '''RSA_4096'''
 * '''RSA_8192'''

is based on the PBKDF2 algorithm, which again is a special way to generated a Symmetric Key, just as normal Symmetric Keys.
The allowed values are:

!anchor sanitized
!4 '''Sanitized'''
Any server relies on the storage for correctness. If the storage used has flaws and the stored data is being altered as a consequence of this, then
it may have drastic consequences. Something which is encrypted may be rendered unreadable of just a single bit has been flipped. It is therefore
essential that the storage is always correct. To help with this, CWS has a feature build-in, which runs sanitizing checks at frequent interval,
so all data will be checked at least once every x days, where x is defined as a system property (cws.sanity.check.interval.days).

The sanitizing request is an administrative request, and the result is a list of Data Id's, of the stored Objects where their checksums no longer
match the encrypted data. The check can be made generally or for a Circle of Trust or simply as a check if new errors have occurred since a certain
date.

!4 '''Circles of Trust'''
Circles of Trust is a core part of CWS, as this is the grouping of Members or
''Trustees'', to facilitte sharing of information. There are no limits as to
who may create a Circle of Trust. Circles of Trust do not have an Owner, but
rather one or more Circle Administrators. The first Member to create a Circle
will automatically become the initial Circle Administrator - or if a Member Id
is given, then this Member will be the initial Circle Administrator.

Circles of Trust do not have much information initially - basically just their
name, which must be unique. Circles of Trust may also have an external Circle
Key, which means a shared Key that can be used by Trustees from a Client system.

 * Create Circle - Creates a new Circle of Trust in CWS
   * SOAP: processCircle with Action "CREATE"
   * REST (POST) request is: [PROTOCOL://HOST:PORT]/cws/circles/createCircle
 * Update Circle - Allows the Circle of Trust to be renamed
   * SOAP: processCircle with Action "UPDATE"
   * REST (POST) request is: [PROTOCOL://HOST:PORT]/cws/circles/updateCircle
 * Delete Circle - Removes a Circle with all Trustees & Data from the System
   * SOAP: processCircle with Action "DELETE"
   * REST (POST) request is: [PROTOCOL://HOST:PORT]/cws/circles/deleteCircle
 * Fetch Circles - Retrieves a list of Circles in the current CWS instance
   * SOAP: fetchCircles
   * REST (POST) request is: [PROTOCOL://HOST:PORT]/cws/circles/fetchCircles

The Fetch Circles request is intended to get a listing of all the current Circles in CWS, note that only if a user is Member of a Circle,
can they retrieve the Circle Key.

The !-CWS-! Create Circle request can be performed by all standard accounts.

If a Fetch Members for a given User is invoked now, then the list of Circles which the Member is entrusted with will also be returned.

However, the Fetch Members request with the Circle listing is pruned, and instead the fetch Trustees should be used, as it will
return a more accurate depiction of the relations. Note, that this request is more stringent in the results returned. System
Administrators are allowed to retrieve most information but members are only allowed to retrieve information if a relation between
the Member & Circle already exists.

!4 '''Data Type'''
Since all data is stored in CWS encrypted, and CWS only cares that the bytes which
came in, also goes out - it can be hard for an application or server using CWS to
ascertain what is behind the bytes. For this reason, CWS supports storing data with
a "data type".

Data Types can be anything; by default 2 types exist: "folder" and "data". If nothing
is explicitly defined, the "data" will always be picked. The "folder" is simple there
to provide the possibility to have structures of data, and it has the unique feature
that Data Objects can have a folder as parent. All Circles of Trust will have a standard
folder as their root, and it is used transparently within CWS.

Working with data types requires administrative permissions, the request must be made
as either system administrator or circle administrator. In the example below, admin is
a system administrator, user1 is a circle administrator and user2 is neither.

!-<img src="files/note.png" align="left">-! Contrary to all other entities in CWS, data types do not have any id's, they
only have a name and a custom definition. It is only allow

There are 3 kinds of actions / requests which can be made for data Types
