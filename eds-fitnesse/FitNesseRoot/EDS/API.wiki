!1 !-<img src="files/javadog.png"> API - Application Programming Interface -!
The EDS API consists of 2 main parts, the first is the management part, which
is used to control a EDS instance, and the second is the sharing part. The full
documentation of the API can be found [[here][https://javadog.io/apidocs/]]

There was both a SOAP & REST based !-WebService-! available, the default for
the !-FitNesse-! tests is the REST, if the SOAP based !-WebServices-! are still
required, please use version 1.2, as that is the final version with SOAP
support, as of 2.0 SOAP support has been discontinued.

Note; EDS is not a HTTP(S) Server, it is an Application, the REST requests will
therefore always return the standard HTTP code 200, whenever an incoming request
has been answered by the EDS. A different !-ReturnCode-! & !-ReturnMessage-! is
set in the response, which will provide more details if the request could not
be processed correctly. The EDS !-ReturnCodes-! are similar to the HTTP codes,
so understanding them should be easier, but the !-ReturnMessage-! is containing
significantly more details regarding the problem. This was decided to ensure
that a System using EDS can better deal with the problems without having to
resort to EDS logs.

!2 Management
Management primarily contain the functionality which is used to control
the system, including altering settings. Adding a system specific !-MasterKey-!
as well as creating Members, Circles of Trust and assign Members as Trustees to
the Circles.

'''Important'''; ''The very first request made with the '''admin''' account will
also set the password for the administrator. By default, the passphrase is empty
or undefined. Which means that it can be set to anything the administrator
prefers, thus preventing that someone forgets to change the default. It is
recommended that common best practices regarding the pick of the passphrase is
followed - for the sake of this test, it is set to 'admin'.''

!* Version

!anchor version
!4 '''Version'''
Returns the current Version of the running EDS instance. This method serves
mainly as a simply way to check if the system is operational. This request is
the only EDS request not requiring any credentials to invoke.

!* !-MasterKey-!
[[ Top ][#content]]
!anchor masterkey
!4 '''!-MasterKey-!'''
The !-MasterKey-!, is a special System Key, which is not stored anywhere. It is
being created at startup and lives only in the memory of the system until shut
down. The !-MasterKey-! is used for multiple internal things, such as extra key
to unlock accounts. It is therefore not possible to update the !-MasterKey-!,
once the system is being used, since it would essentially convert the EDS
database to a brick, since all keys becomes invalid.

There are 2 ways to set the !-MasterKey-! to something else than the default,
either by using the !-MasterKey WebService-! request or by setting a URL, from
which the raw data to build the key from can be read. To prevent any problems,
in the following, the !-MasterKey-! is reverted to the original, to ensure that
the next test run will also work.

!5 Symmetric Algorithm
The primary part of all internal encryption is performed using Symmetric Keys. These are all based on the AES algorithms
and only the size of the keys may be changed. The default value is '''AES_GCM_256''', if there are problems with
allowing this Key size, then it can be set to a lower value. It should be noted, that AES encryption using CBC is
considered ''unsecure'', so it is recommended to change the algorithm to GCM.
The allowed values are:
 * '''AES_CBC_128'''
 * '''AES_CBC_192'''
 * '''AES_CBC_256'''
 * '''AES_GCM_128'''
 * '''AES_GCM_192'''
 * '''AES_GCM_256'''

!5 Asymmetric Algorithm
Each Member Account will have a Asymmetric Key generated by default, this is used to encrypt and decrypt the Symmetric Keys, as well as Signing and Verifying signatures.
Higher Key size will give higher security. However, Asymmetric encryption/decryption is very costly compared to Symmetric cryptography. Hence, the use of these Keys is
minimized. The default value is '''RSA2048''', increasing this to a higher Key size, will have a drastic performance cost, and should only be done if a higher level of
security is needed or if enough EDS instances with enough resources is being used, so the cost can be mitigated.
The allowed values are:
 * '''RSA_2048'''
 * '''RSA_4096'''
 * '''RSA_8192'''

!anchor sanitized
!4 '''Sanitized'''
Any server relies on the storage for correctness. If the storage used has flaws and the stored data is being altered as a consequence of this, then
it may have drastic consequences. Something which is encrypted may be rendered unreadable of just a single bit has been flipped. It is therefore
essential that the storage is always correct. To help with this, EDS has a feature build-in, which runs sanitizing checks at frequent interval,
so all data will be checked at least once every x days, where x is defined as a system property (eds.sanity.check.interval.days).

The sanitizing request is an administrative request, and the result is a list of Data Id's, of the stored Objects where their checksums no longer
match the encrypted data. The check can be made generally or for a Circle of Trust or simply as a check if new errors have occurred since a certain
date.

[[ Top ][#content]]
!anchor authenticated
!4 '''Authenticated'''
EDS is designed as a backend system to be integrated into other systems, which opens
the question of authentication checks, how to ensure that the standard authentication
checks is aligned with EDS, so EDS can be used to store data securely.

The use-cases for the authentication mechanism is check if an account may access the
securely stored data or not. It is not designed nor intended to replace other
security mechanisms, such as 2FA of existing mechanisms. The check is simply here
to serve the purpose checking if accounts are aligned or not.

This alignment check is required, since the user credentials are needed to unlock
the keys internally. For this reason, the account should use a separate and different
credential to unlock the EDS account, to prevent that poor passwords are passed on to
also weaken the security of the EDS stored data.

 * Authenticated - Check Member Authentication
   * REST (POST) request is: ${REST_ROOT}/authenticated

Firstly, there are 2 ways to create accounts, both require system administrative
permissions. The first way is to run the CREATE action the second is to use the
INVITE action. The CREATE action requires that the new account is completely defined,
i.e. that the account name and credentials. The INVITE will just require the account
name and issue a signature that the new user can use to unlock the account.

Once accounts are in usage, it may not be feasible to constantly provide both the
account name and credentials. Hence, it is possible to perform a LOGIN. This will
take an Account and an existing Session and link them together for a brief period of
time, how brief is defined via the settings. The session is then the only information
required to identify and unlock the account. Since the Session is thus used as both
an identification and authentication value, it must be guarded well. The Account should
by the end of a session invoke the LOGOUT.

It should be noted, that it is not possible to change the credentials for an Account
using the Session!

!4 '''Circles of Trust'''
Circles of Trust is a core part of EDS, as this is the grouping of Members or
''Trustees'', to facilitate sharing of information. There are no limits as to
who may create a Circle of Trust. Circles of Trust do not have an Owner, but
rather one or more Circle Administrators. The first Member to create a Circle
will automatically become the initial Circle Administrator - or if a Member Id
is given, then this Member will be the initial Circle Administrator.

Circles of Trust do not have much information initially - basically just their
name, which must be unique. Circles of Trust may also have an external Circle
Key, which means a shared Key that can be used by Trustees from a Client system.

The Fetch Circles request is intended to get a listing of all the current Circles in EDS, note that only if a user is Member of a Circle,
can they retrieve the Circle Key.

However, the Fetch Members request with the Circle listing is pruned, and instead the fetch Trustees should be used, as it will
return a more accurate depiction of the relations. Note, that this request is more stringent in the results returned. System
Administrators are allowed to retrieve most information but members are only allowed to retrieve information if a relation between
the Member & Circle already exists.

!4 '''Data Type'''
Since all data is stored in EDS encrypted, and EDS only cares that the bytes which
came in, also goes out - it can be hard for an application or server using EDS to
ascertain what is behind the bytes. For this reason, EDS supports storing data with
a "data type".

Data Types can be anything; by default 2 types exist: "folder" and "data". If nothing
is explicitly defined, the "data" will always be picked. The "folder" is simple there
to provide the possibility to have structures of data, and it has the unique feature
that Data Objects can have a folder as parent. All Circles of Trust will have a standard
folder as their root, and it is used transparently within EDS.

Working with data types requires administrative permissions, the request must be made
as either system administrator or circle administrator. In the example below, admin is
a system administrator, user1 is a circle administrator and user2 is neither.

!-<img src="files/note.png" align="left">-! Contrary to all other entities in EDS, data types do not have any id's, they
only have a name and a custom definition. It is only allow

There are 3 kinds of actions / requests which can be made for data Types

Signing documents means creating cryptographic checksum of the document based on the signing members key. The signature can then be given to others together with the document, to verify that the document has not been tampered with.
EDS supports simply signing of documents, and later verification of same by other members. Neither the document signed, nor the signature are stored in EDS, only some meta information regarding who signed it and optionally when it expires.

!3 '''Inventory Report'''

For administrators, using EDS as part of their system, to store certain or all Objects, they may require a way to synchronize the repositories. For this reason, the Inventory Report is present, it can only be invoked by a System Administrator, and will return a list of all Objects, ordered by the most recent first to the oldest last.
