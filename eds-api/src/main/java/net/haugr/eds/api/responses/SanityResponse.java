/**
 * <p>Returns a list of Data Objects, which have failed their sanity checks,

 * they no longer can be decrypted.</p>
 *
 * <p>If the CircleId is given in the request, then the resulting list is
 * limited to the records for the given Circle, same applies to the timestamp,
 * since, which means that only newer record information is being retrieved.</p>
 *
 * <p>For any system, having <i>any</i> results from request is considered a
